Objective: We will perform a UX and copywriting overhaul on the "Observation" section of our "Trust-Building Proposal Card" in client/src/pages/client/recommendations.tsx. The goal is to apply sales psychology principles to make the data more persuasive, create a sense of urgency, and clearly demonstrate the value of our proposed action.

Action: Open client/src/pages/client/recommendations.tsx and replace the current, text-heavy "The Observation" section with the new, structured component detailed below.

New "Observation" Blueprint:

Instead of a single paragraph, the new section will consist of:

A concise, hard-hitting Insight Statement that summarizes the core problem.

A Data Breakdown that visually presents 1-2 key examples as evidence.

A Quantified Opportunity Statement that frames the problem in terms of what the client is losing.

Here is the JSX snippet to replace the existing "Observation" section. Please integrate it into the recommendations.tsx file.

      This gap between your high ranking and low click-through rate indicates a significant amount of lost traffic. By not capturing these clicks, you are missing out on potential clients who are actively searching for your services.
