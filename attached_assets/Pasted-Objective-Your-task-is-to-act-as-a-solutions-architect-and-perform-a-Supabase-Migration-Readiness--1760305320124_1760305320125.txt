Objective: Your task is to act as a solutions architect and perform a "Supabase Migration Readiness Assessment" on our entire "Agency Client Portal" repository. The goal is to determine the feasibility of migrating our current Neon PostgreSQL database, custom authentication, and file storage to the Supabase platform.

Please analyze the full codebase and provide a structured report that assesses the compatibility of our current architecture and outlines the required steps and potential challenges for the migration. Address each of the following points in your report.

Supabase Migration Readiness Assessment Checklist
1. Database & Schema Analysis:

Drizzle Schema Compatibility: Review the schema defined in shared/schema.ts. Is it fully compatible with a standard PostgreSQL database, making it directly usable with a new Supabase project?

Migration Path: Confirm that our existing Drizzle Kit setup (drizzle.config.ts and the /migrations folder) can be pointed to a new Supabase database connection string to manage the schema migration.

Data Dependencies: Identify any database-specific features or extensions we might be using from our current provider that may not be available on Supabase's standard PostgreSQL offering.

2. Authentication System Refactoring Analysis:

Code Impact Assessment: Analyze the current custom authentication system (server/routes.ts for auth endpoints, server/lib/jwt.ts, server/middleware/auth.ts). Quantify the effort required to replace this with the supabase-js client library for user sign-up, login, and session management.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Our profiles table contains a role column ('Admin', 'Staff', 'Client'). How can our existing role-based access control middleware (requireRole) be adapted to work with Supabase's JWTs and user management?

Client-Side Impact: Review the frontend files that interact with authentication (client/src/lib/auth.ts, client/src/pages/login.tsx, client/src/components/protected-route.tsx). Outline the changes needed to switch from our custom apiRequest token handling to the Supabase client.

3. File & PDF Storage Migration Plan:

Identify Current Method: Analyze server/services/pdfStorage.ts and server/services/invoiceGenerator.ts. Confirm that we are currently saving files to the local filesystem, which is not scalable.

Propose Supabase Solution: Detail the steps to refactor pdfStorage.ts to use Supabase Storage instead. This should involve using the supabase-js client to upload the PDF buffer generated by puppeteer and saving the public URL back to the invoices table.

4. API Endpoint & Business Logic Review:

Identify Candidates for Replacement: Review server/routes.ts. List which API endpoints are simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations that could potentially be replaced by direct, secure frontend calls to Supabase's auto-generated REST API.

Identify Essential Business Logic: List the complex API endpoints that must remain in our Express server because they contain critical business logic that cannot be replicated with a simple database API. (e.g., the SEO Audit endpoint, AI analysis routes, invoice generation logic).

5. Overall Migration Summary:

Feasibility Score: Based on your analysis, provide an overall assessment of the project's readiness for a Supabase migration (e.g., "High," "Medium," "Low").

Primary Blockers & Risks: Identify the top 2-3 biggest challenges or risks we would face during this migration (e.g., "Refactoring authentication will be complex," "Data migration from the old DB to the new one will need a separate script").

Recommended First Step: Suggest the single most logical first action to take to begin this migration (e.g., "Set up a new Supabase project and run the initial schema migration").

Please begin the assessment and present your detailed findings.
