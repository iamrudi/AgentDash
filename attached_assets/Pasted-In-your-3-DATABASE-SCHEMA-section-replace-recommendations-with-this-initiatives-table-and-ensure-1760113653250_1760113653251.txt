## Core Feature: AI Recommendation Engine (Initiative-Based)
The AI Recommendation Engine is a scheduled backend process that generates Strategic Initiatives. Its output is a JSON object containing a high-level initiative object (title, observation) AND a proposed_tasks array, which is a list of specific, actionable task descriptions required to execute the initiative. This allows for one-to-many relationships (one strategy, many tasks).

// --- UPDATE: In your # 5. UI/UX BLUEPRINT section, REPLACE the blueprint for the 'Recommendations Page' with this new, more detailed version. --- //

## Agency Portal UI (Initiative Triage)
The goal is to provide a fast and powerful review process for the Account Manager (AM).

Location: The main dashboard's "AI Recommendations Inbox".

Review Modal: When an AM reviews a new initiative, a modal appears.

It displays the AI-generated title and observation in editable fields.

Below, it displays the proposed_tasks in a compact, searchable table with a checkbox next to each task.

Bulk Actions like "Select All" / "Deselect All" must be included.

A dynamic summary at the top must show "X of Y tasks selected" and the calculated total cost/hours.

The AM finalizes the task list and clicks "Send Initiative to Client".

## Client Portal UI (Initiative Presentation & Results)
The goal is to present the initiative strategically and prove its value transparently.

Recommendations Page:

An Accordion layout lists pending initiatives.

When expanded, the client sees the strategic observation and proposed_action.

Crucially, it displays a summarized "Scope of Work" (e.g., "• Optimize 23 Page Meta Titles").

An optional "View Full Task List" link is available to show a read-only modal with all individual tasks for full transparency.

The client approves the entire initiative package.

Implementation: Upon approval, the system automatically creates multiple tasks in the tasks table, one for each approved item, and links them all to the single initiative_id.

Results Page (The Impact Report):

This page will display a gallery of "Impact Cards" for all initiatives with a status of Measured.

Each card is a mini case study showing "What We Did" (the initiative title), "Date Completed", and the final "Result" (e.g., "↑ 40% in Average Organic CTR"), along with a brief summary sentence.
