# Production URL Configuration

Public forms/embed endpoints have been removed from this platform because the feature depended on CRM-linked flows that are out of scope.

Removed endpoints:
- `GET /api/public/forms/:publicId`
- `POST /api/public/forms/:publicId/submit`
- `GET /forms/embed/:publicId`
