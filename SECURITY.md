## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Open a Public Issue

**Never** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report Privately

Send a detailed report to: **security@agencyportal.com**

Include in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Update**: Within 10 business days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity (typically 30-90 days)

### 4. Disclosure Policy

We follow **coordinated disclosure**:

1. You report the vulnerability privately
2. We confirm and assess the issue
3. We develop and test a fix
4. We release the security patch
5. We publish a security advisory (with credit to you, if desired)
6. You may publicly disclose after patch release

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Environment Variables

- **Never commit** `.env` files to version control
- Generate strong secrets:
  \`\`\`bash
  openssl rand -hex 32
  \`\`\`
- Use different values for `SESSION_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET`
- Use minimum 256-bit encryption keys (64 hex characters)

#### Database Security

- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- Use Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
- Regularly backup your database
- Limit database user permissions

#### API Keys & OAuth

- Rotate API keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Use separate credentials for development/production
- Restrict OAuth redirect URIs to your domains
- Monitor OAuth usage for anomalies

#### Network Security

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Configure proper CORS settings
- Use secure cookies (`secure: true, httpOnly: true`)
- Implement rate limiting (already configured)

### For Developers

#### Authentication & Authorization

- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Enforce agency-level data segregation
- **Role-based access**: Validate user roles on every request
- **Session management**: Use secure session configuration
- **Password security**: Use bcrypt with appropriate cost factor

#### Input Validation

- **Always validate**: Use Zod schemas for all inputs
- **Sanitize outputs**: Prevent XSS attacks
- **Parameterized queries**: Use Drizzle ORM (prevents SQL injection)
- **File uploads**: Validate file types and sizes

#### Encryption

- **Sensitive data**: Encrypt using AES-256-GCM
- **Passwords**: Hash with bcrypt (never store plaintext)
- **Tokens**: Use secure random generation
- **Transport**: Always use HTTPS/TLS

#### Dependencies

- **Regular updates**: Run `npm audit` weekly
- **Automated scanning**: Use Dependabot or similar tools
- **Review changes**: Check changelogs before updating
- **Lock files**: Commit package-lock.json

#### Error Handling

- **Never expose**: Don't leak sensitive info in errors
- **Log properly**: Use structured logging (Winston)
- **Fail securely**: Default to deny on errors

## Security Features

### Current Implementation

#### Multi-Tenant Security

- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level tenant isolation
- **Middleware checks**: Application-level validation
- **JWT context**: Agency ID in secure token metadata

#### Encryption

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key management**: Environment-based keys
- **Encrypted fields**: OAuth tokens, API keys, sensitive client data

#### Rate Limiting

- **General API**: 100 requests / 15 minutes
- **Authentication**: 5 requests / 15 minutes
- **API routes**: 60 requests / minute
- **AI endpoints**: 20 requests / hour

#### Logging & Monitoring

- **Request logging**: Every API call tracked
- **Error tracking**: Comprehensive error logging
- **Audit trail**: Database changes logged
- **Security events**: Failed auth attempts logged

#### Headers & CORS

- **Helmet.js**: Security headers configured
- **CORS**: Restricted to allowed origins
- **CSP**: Content Security Policy enabled
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security

### Planned Enhancements

- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] IP allowlisting/blocklisting
- [ ] Advanced anomaly detection
- [ ] Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Security information and event management (SIEM)

## Known Security Considerations

### Google OAuth Tokens

- Stored encrypted in database
- Automatic refresh implemented
- Rate limiting prevents token abuse

### Data for SEO API

- Client-level credentials stored encrypted
- Per-client quota enforcement
- No cross-client data leakage

### AI Processing

- Input sanitization before Gemini API
- Output validation after generation
- Rate limiting per user/client

## Compliance

### Data Protection

- **GDPR**: User data deletion capabilities
- **Data retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption

### Access Control

- **Principle of least privilege**: Minimal permissions
- **Separation of duties**: Role-based access
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive activity logs
