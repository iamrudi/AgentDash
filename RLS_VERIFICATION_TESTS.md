# RLS Verification Tests

## Test Environment
- **Test Agency 1**: Agency ID `614d7633-5dd9-4147-a261-ebf8458a2ec4`
  - Admin: `agent3@demo.com` / `Agent1234`
  - Client: `jon@mmagency.co.uk` / `Letmein120`
- **Test Agency 2**: If you have another agency for testing

## Test Suite

### Test 1: Verify JWT Contains agency_id

**In Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Check all users have agency_id in JWT
SELECT 
  id,
  email,
  raw_app_meta_data->>'agency_id' as agency_id_in_jwt,
  raw_user_meta_data->>'role' as role
FROM auth.users
ORDER BY email;
```

**Expected Result:** All users should have `agency_id_in_jwt` populated (not NULL).

---

### Test 2: Verify RLS is Enabled

**In Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Check RLS is enabled on all tables
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  tablename, 
  rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename IN (
    'agencies', 'profiles', 'clients', 'projects', 'tasks', 
    'staff_assignments', 'invoices', 'invoice_line_items',
    'initiatives', 'daily_metrics', 'client_integrations',
    'client_objectives', 'client_messages', 'notifications'
  )
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Expected Result:** All tables should show `rowsecurity = true`.

---

### Test 3: Verify Helper Functions Work

**In Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Test helper functions exist
SELECT 
  routine_name, 
  routine_schema 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name IN ('get_agency_id', 'is_authenticated')
  AND routine_schema = 'public';
```

**Expected Result:** Both functions should be listed.

---

### Test 4: Application-Level Testing

#### 4A: Admin Access Test

1. **Logout** from application (if logged in)
2. **Login** as `agent3@demo.com` / `Agent1234` (Admin)
3. **Navigate to Clients page**
4. **Verify:** You see only clients from Agency 1 (e.g., "MMA Marketing")
5. **Check browser console:** No errors should appear

#### 4B: Client Access Test

1. **Logout** from application
2. **Login** as `jon@mmagency.co.uk` / `Letmein120` (Client)
3. **Navigate to Dashboard**
4. **Verify:** You see only your own client data
5. **Check browser console:** No errors should appear

---

### Test 5: Database-Level Isolation Test

**This is the critical security test - verifying RLS blocks unauthorized access at the database level.**

#### 5A: Count Total Clients (Without RLS Context)

**In Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- As admin/service role, see ALL clients across agencies
SELECT 
  c.id,
  c.name,
  c.agency_id,
  a.name as agency_name
FROM clients c
JOIN agencies a ON a.id = c.agency_id
ORDER BY a.name, c.name;
```

**Expected Result:** Shows clients from ALL agencies (Service role bypasses RLS).

#### 5B: Verify RLS Blocks Cross-Agency Access

**Test Plan:**

1. **Create a SQL function** that simulates a user query:

```sql
-- Create test function that runs with user's permissions
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test_rls_isolation(test_user_id UUID)
RETURNS TABLE(client_count BIGINT) AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Set the JWT context to simulate the user
  PERFORM set_config('request.jwt.claims', 
    json_build_object(
      'sub', test_user_id::text,
      'app_metadata', json_build_object(
        'agency_id', (
          SELECT p.agency_id::text 
          FROM profiles p 
          WHERE p.id = test_user_id
        )
      )
    )::text, 
    true
  );
  
  -- Try to query clients (RLS will filter automatically)
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clients;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Test as Admin user (agent3@demo.com)
SELECT * FROM test_rls_isolation(
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'agent3@demo.com')
);
```

**Expected Result:** Should return only the count of clients in Agent3's agency.

---

### Test 6: Cross-Agency Data Leak Test

**Verify users CANNOT access other agencies' data:**

#### Method 1: Direct SQL Attempt

**In Supabase SQL Editor (as authenticated user):**

```sql
-- Try to query ALL agencies (should only see your own)
SELECT * FROM agencies;

-- Try to query clients from another agency
SELECT * FROM clients WHERE agency_id != '614d7633-5dd9-4147-a261-ebf8458a2ec4';
```

**Expected Result:** 
- First query: Returns only YOUR agency
- Second query: Returns 0 rows (RLS blocks access)

#### Method 2: API Endpoint Test

**In browser console (F12) while logged in:**

```javascript
// Try to fetch all clients
const response = await fetch('/api/agency/clients');
const clients = await response.json();
console.log('Clients visible to me:', clients);

// All clients should belong to YOUR agency only
const allFromMyAgency = clients.every(
  c => c.agencyId === '<your-agency-id>'
);
console.log('All clients from my agency?', allFromMyAgency);
```

**Expected Result:** `allFromMyAgency` should be `true`.

---

### Test 7: Nested Relationship Access

**Verify RLS works for deeply nested relationships:**

**In application or browser console:**

```javascript
// Fetch tasks (which require: task -> project -> client -> agency)
const tasksResponse = await fetch('/api/tasks');
const tasks = await tasksResponse.json();
console.log('Tasks visible:', tasks);

// All tasks should belong to projects in YOUR agency's clients
```

**Expected Result:** Only tasks from your agency's projects are returned.

## âœ… Pass Criteria

All tests must pass:

- [x] All users have `agency_id` in JWT `app_metadata`
- [x] All tables have RLS enabled (`rowsecurity = true`)
- [x] Helper functions exist and are executable
- [x] Admin users see only their agency's data
- [x] Client users see only their own data
- [x] Database-level queries respect RLS policies
- [x] Cross-agency access attempts return 0 rows
- [x] Nested relationship queries are properly filtered

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Users can't see ANY data after RLS

**Solution:**

1. Check JWT has agency_id:
```sql
SELECT id, email, raw_app_meta_data->>'agency_id' 
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = '<user-email>';
```

2. If NULL, user needs to logout/login again
3. If still NULL, re-run migration 2

### Issue: Users see data from other agencies

**Solution:**

1. Verify RLS is enabled:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'clients';
```

2. If `rowsecurity = false`, re-run migration 1
3. Check policy exists:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'clients';
```

### Issue: Database queries fail with permission errors

**Solution:**

Ensure helper functions have correct permissions:
```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.get_agency_id() TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.is_authenticated() TO authenticated;
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Indicators

**You'll know RLS is working correctly when:**

1. âœ… Users can access their own agency's data seamlessly
2. âœ… Users CANNOT see other agencies' data (even if they try)
3. âœ… No database errors in application logs
4. âœ… SQL queries automatically respect tenant boundaries
5. âœ… Even service role (admin) SQL shows RLS is active
